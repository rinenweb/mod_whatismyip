## Module - What is my IP
# description
What is my IP is a simple Joomla module that displays the visitor's IP Address.

# Requirements
What is my IP Module is fairly simple and will (hopefully) play nice with:
- [x] Joomla 4.X
- [x] Joomla 5.X
- [x] PHP 8.0+

# Installation
+ Download the What is my IP Module from here.
+ Navigate to the Joomla administrator panel.
+ Go to System -> Install -> Extensions.
+ Upload and install the module package.
+ Find the "Module - What is my IP" module and enable it.

# Usage
The only option in the module's settings is to set an intro text that will be displayed right before the IP Address. Of course you can also set a Module Class Suffix for individual CSS styling.
